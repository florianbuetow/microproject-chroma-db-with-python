# Chroma DB Python Test Project

## About

This is a hands-on test project designed to explore and understand ChromaDB using Python. ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database that makes it easy to build AI applications with vector search capabilities.

Through this project, you can experiment with:

- Vector embeddings
- Similarity search
- Document storage and retrieval
- Basic ChromaDB operations and queries

## Scripts Usage

### Setup Script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script sets up your development environment by:

1. Creating a Python virtual environment
2. Installing all required dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Initializing any necessary configurations

### Run Script

./run.sh
```

This script:

1. Activates the Python virtual environment
2. Executes the main application

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Basic understanding of vector databases and embeddings

## Getting Started
